The file Git_Readme.pdf can't be edited. I therefore copy the content and make a new md file. The pictures are gone. We have to insert the corresponding graphics.
We may rename the image files to avoid file conflicts:
Here are the correspondances:
GitInstallDefault
DefaultEditor
AdjustingPath
HttpsConnect
LineEnding
DefaultTerminal
