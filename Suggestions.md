The file Git_Readme.pdf can't be edited. I therefore copy the content and make a new md file. The pictures are gone. We have to insert the corresponding graphics.
We may rename the image files to avoid file conflicts:
Here are the correspondances:
GitInstallDefault = image1
DefaultEditor = image2
AdjustingPath = image3
HttpsConnect = image4
LineEnding = image5
DefaultTerminal = image6
