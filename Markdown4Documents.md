_*Inserting backslah escapes*_

Markdown uses many symbols to specify its syntax. If we want to write any of them without being interpreted, Markdown provides backslash escapes (\) for the following characters:

\   backslash`   backtick*   asterisk_   underscore{}  curly braces[]  square brackets()  parentheses#   hash mark+   plus sign-   minus sign (hyphen).   dot!   exclamation mark

_*Inserting HTML*_
Finally, Markdown allows you to include raw HTML. You may write HTML code anywhere in a document. Consider the following example:

This is a paragraph.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is another paragraph.
